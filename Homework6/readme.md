# Grid Search and Cross Validation

## Dataset Description

Our data is a labeled set of health statistics which describe womens health in a Native American tribe. The women are classified into 2 groups with or without diabetes

## Business Question/Problem Statement

Can we predict, based on health evaluations, the occurence of diabetes in women of the Pima tribe?

## Exploratory Analysis Findings

The data is very clean, with no missing datapoints. The labels are also fairly well balanced so we are able to use accuracy as a scoring metric.

## Regression Results

We predicted the class variable with an accuracy of 73%

## Potential Next Steps and Follow-ups

There is potential to use a different classifier, collecting more data over a longer period of time might also help with prediction.
