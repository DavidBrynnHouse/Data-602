# Estimating Power Generation of Windmills

data used - https://github.com/DavidBrynnHouse/Data-602/blob/main/Homework3/data/wind.csv

This project seeks to use data gathered from windmills to create a predictor which can estimate the power generated by a windmill given features including windspeed, wind direction, and air temperature.
