data used - https://github.com/DavidBrynnHouse/Data-602/blob/main/Homework3/data/wind.csv

Data was retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/synergystud/a-fine-windy-day-hackerearth-ml-challenge

##Features in the dataset:

    datetime - a string reperesenting the time snapshot when the data was collected
    wind_speed - a measure of how fast the wind was going in meters per second
    atmospheric_temperature - ambient temperature in celcius
    shaft_temperature - the temperature of the windmill shaft in celcius
    blades_angle - angle of blades in relation to the windstream in degrees
    gearbox_temperature - the temperature of the windmill gearbox
    engine_temperature - the temperature of the windmill engine.
    motor_torque - the torque exerted on the motor in Newton meters
    generator_temperature - the temperature of the gemerator
    atmospheric_pressure - the outside pressure measured in pascals
    area_temperature - the measured temperature around the windmill
    windmill_body_temperature - the temperature of the windmill body in celcius
    wind_direction - the direction the wind is pointing in degrees
    resistance - the electrical resistance of the windmill measured in degrees
    rotor_torque - the torque exerted by the rotor in Newton meters
    turbine_status - Unspecified, assumed to be physics condition of the windmill
    cloud_level - categorical and ordinal description of the cloud level
    blade_length - the length of the windmill blades in meters
    blade_bredth - the total bredth of the windmill blades
    windmill_height - the height of the windmill
    windmill_generated_power - the power generated by the windmill in kW/h


This project seeks to use data gathered from windmills to create a predictor which can estimate the power generated by a windmill given features including windspeed, wind direction, and air temperature.

EDA performed on this dataset revealed that several of the features contained illogical data, e.g. wind speeds higher than any in recorded history, similarly improbable temperatures etc.. However, there are enough believable features that a realistic regression should be possible.
