## Dataset Description
This is a dataset which describes different flights around the world. It has features which describe wind speed, flight time, destination, and more.

## Business Question/Problem Statement
Can we predict wheather or not a flight is delayed using the given features?

## Exploratory Analysis Findings
There were a few missing values, but not so many that we could not impute the values. Though we did notice that there were missing labels so we had to remove those observations.

## Results
We were able to get an accuracy score of around 70%

## Potential Next Steps and Follow-ups
We might want to use different classifiers/ collect more or different data.
